# ¿Qué c*ño hago con mi vida?
Tired of not knowing what to do during these qurantine times? Me too, that's why I created "What the hell am I doing with my life?"
an Android app that tells you what the hell you should do!

It is based on the classic game "Magic 8 Ball", in which you can also include your own phrases so you can recommend your friends
what the hell they should also do.
